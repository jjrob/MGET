# Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET)

Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET), is a Python library and associated
ArcGIS geoprocessing toolbox produced by the [Marine Geospatial Ecology
Lab](https://mgel.env.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/). MGET
provides Python functions and corresponding ArcGIS geoprocessing tools for
working with ecological and oceanographic data.

## Under construction

As of March 2024, we are in the process of porting [MGET
0.8](https://mgel.env.duke.edu/mget/), which is only only available for 32-bit
Python 2.x with ArcGIS 10.x running on Microsoft Windows, to 64-bit Python 3.x
with ArcGIS Pro 3.2 running on Windows and Linux. For now, this repository is
considered unstable and not recommended for use. Please contact [Jason
Roberts](mailto:jason.roberts@duke.edu) to inquire about the project status or
if you have other questions.
